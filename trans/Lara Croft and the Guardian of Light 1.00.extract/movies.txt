#001.60:(Lara) According to Aztec myth, the region we call the Yucatan
#005.04:is an ancient battleground where the human followers of Totec,
#008.12:the Guardian of Light, once waged a catastrophic war
#011.22:against the demonic forces of Xolotl, the Keeper of Darkness.
#015.25:It is written that Xolotl called upon the power of an artifact
#019.02:known as the Mirror of Smoke
#021.00:to summon forth a horde of unspeakable horrors from the Abyss.
#025.27:Totec's warriors were slaughtered in the battle that followed,
#028.20:but Totec himself survived.
#030.20:He found a way to turn the Mirror's power back against the evil god.
#034.70:Xolotl was imprisoned within the mirror,
#036.90:and the descendants of Totec went on to forge a mighty empire
#040.60:that lasted until the arrival of the conquistadors.
#043.70:As for what happened to the Mirror of Smoke,
#046.10:the ancient texts are vague.
#048.40:Some say it was hidden in a secret place...
#050.60:That the mirror was lost forever...
#052.88:But if there's one thing I've learned...
#055.20:It's that nothing is lost forever.
#058.90:And here it is.
#060.26:After weeks of hiking through the treacherous Central American Jungle,
#063.86:I finally found the Mirror of Smoke.
#067.04:It isn't much to look at.
#068.45:But that's something else I've learned...
#070.33:appearances can be deceiving.
#073.00:Apparently these guys know it too.
#075.00:Meet Vasco, the local warlord.
#077.77:Vasco's been after the mirror for years...
#079.90:but he couldn't find it.
#081.30:Not without my help, anyway.
#083.80:I guess Vasco doesn't read much, either.
#086.18:He doesn't seem to know about the curse,
#088.50:or maybe he just doesn't believe it.
#097.00:(Totec) Xolotl! Face me!
#099.45:(Xolotl) You are not worthy Totec.
#103.10:(Totec) Have you forgotten the last time we met in battle?
#107.20:(Xolotl) A new day has dawned. And soon... 
#110.50:night will fall on this world for the last time!
#115.80:(Totec) You know not the darkness you have unleashed.
#118.40:Xolotl will drown this world in blood.
#121.20:(Lara) No need to be dramatic.
#122.90:Surely there's a way to set this right.
#124.80:(Totec) Xolotl must be imprisoned within the mirror
#127.30:and returned to this place before the light of dawn.
#130.38:It is the only way to stop him.
#134.80:Stand back. 
#136.10:This is no job for a woman.
#138.00:(Lara) Perhaps you should stand back.
#140.16:Unless you want to singe that pretty skirt of yours.
#143.30:Step away from that door or
#144.60:this bomb is going to hurt more than your pride.

#000.89:(Xolotl) How... can this be?!
#002.70:(Lara) Looks like you're out of luck.
#004.50:(Xolotl) Noooo!
#008.10:(Totec) Hurry! We must get the Mirror back to its shrine
#010.70:before the first light of dawn.
#015.40:Quickly! Replace the mirror!
#016.97:(Lara) What about you?
#017.86:(Totec) I must remain and protect our age of light.
#021.25:It is my destiny.
#023.17:Now return the mirror!
#033.33:(Lara) Take care, Totec.
#035.85:The mirror has been returned to its secret place,
#038.70:and Xolotl to his eternal prison.
#041.70:When I'm gone, this place will be lost again...
#044.59:but for how long?
#046.69:If there's one thing I've learned in all my travels...
#049.70:it's that nothing is lost forever...
#052.43:but some things should never be found.

#050.00:(Lara) That was certainly unexpected.
