Text and subtitle translator application for Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider games.

This project originally made for Tomb Raider Anniversary & Legend, and I'm upgrading for Tomb Raider 2013 and for community/collaborative translating.
This app (now) isn't compatible with older CD's games, but if once TR 2013 upgrade finished, I'll make it compatible with older games again.
Exported texts available in crowdin.net (http://crowdin.net/project/translation-for-tomb-raider-20) 

IMPORTANT: This project uses .resx files for translation source, but exported texts' format can be changed later!


UPDATE:
Project currently is upgrading for supporting multiple games with same code base (At first: Tomb Raider (2013) and Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light).
